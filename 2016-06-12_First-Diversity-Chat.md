## Discussion Summary
### Events
* **Questions**
  * How can we design events that emphasize diversity and inclusion?

* **As organizers**
  * **Choose accessible venues** - for example, consider places that don’t serve alcohol, aren’t too loud to be heard, are accessible to those with mobility concerns, and have gender neutral bathrooms. Speaking about your choices in the description of the event goes a long way to show underrepresented groups that they are welcome.
  * **Develop a Code of conduct** that is taken seriously and enforced by the community.
  * **Encourage the respectful attendance of men at women-oriented meetups** to hear new perspectives. 
  * **Personally invite people with power** to diversity focused meetups (eg. male CEOs).

* **As attendees**
  * Use a **Buddy System** for industry meetups - make an effort to support one another if attending a meetup that seems like it might be intimidatingly homogeneous (eg. being the only woman or visible minority at meetup consisting mainly of straight white men)
  * **Encourage the attendance of men at women-oriented meetups** to hear new perspectives. People react very well to being invited personally, and word of mouth is very powerful.

* **Event ideas**
  * **Mixed-Discipline hack events** to help encourage the involvement of people who work in the tech industry, but who may feel less valued because their seems less important or prestigious than that of developers or engineers.

  * **Job Jam** - support for job hunters, either on a meetup scale or a larger, more formal event with panel discussions and support from YYJ tech industry professionals
    * Mock interviews
    * Resume help
    * Interview shadowing and tips

* **Resources**

### Workplace
* **Hiring**
  * How can we make our job postings appeal to a more diverse audience?
  * How can we improve the hiring process in general?
  * How can we measure our progress?
  * **Develop and share resources for improving diversity in hiring** (eg. interview question and format suggestions, job posting guidelines)

* **Management**
  * How can we make it easy to **report injustice without repercussion?**
  * How can we improve the **employee/management feedback process?**
  * How can we make sure that everyone has **equal access to promotions, mentorship, and career growth?**

* **Culture**
  * **What can we do to make workplace events more inclusive?** (eg. is Beer Fridays the best way to bond with everyone at the office?)
  * **Champion the accomplishments of others** (eg. a #wins channel for things like I finally got my environment working!)
  * **Give credit** to the person who actually did the work, not just to the loudest person on the project

### Outreach
* **What’s going well?**
  * **Ladies Learning Code and Girls Learning Code**
    * development workshops for women and girls

* **What can be improved? How can we help?** 
  * Make it more clear that **men are welcome to mentor**.
  * How could LLC be **more inclusive to non-binary genders?**
  * **Mentor**
  * If your company has the means, **sponsor programs that do outreach.**
  * **Outreach to grade schools** (eg. career fairs, giving talks in elementary and high schools)

### Unconscious Bias
* **Questions**
  * How can we be better allies?
  * How can we provide support to folks who want to be better allies?

### Marketing
* **Make a positive, inclusive community part of the Victoria Tech Brand**, possibly working with City Hall to promote initiatives.
* **Create documentation and resources that show how people can help** for different types of people who are interested in improving diversity in the industry.
* Pitch diversity articles to media (eg. VentureBeat), **hold local media accountable** for featuring diversity when they talk about tech (eg. this tech CEO panel in [Capital Magazine](https://issuu.com/timescolonist/docs/capbizsum2016/57?e=11361121/36163453))
